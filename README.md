# Lipophilicity-Fingerprint-Model
Training a fingerprint-based model using the Lipophilicity dataset with a Jupyter notebook.



Clone the repository and create a Conda environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Lipophilicity-Fingerprint-Model.git
cd Lipophilicity-Fingerprint-Model
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate fingerprint_model



# After setting up the environment, open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook



# Running the notebook will output a file named `results.txt` in the project directory. This file includes the test set RMSE, the Conda environment name, and the hyperparameters used for training.
